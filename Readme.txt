Part 1: Basic Structure
Create the Container:

Add a <div id="container"></div> in your HTML.
This will act as the container for the grid.
Style the Container:

In style.css, define the size of the container (e.g., 960px x 960px).
Use display: flex and flex-wrap: wrap to prepare it for the grid layout.
Part 2: Grid Creation
Generate the Grid Dynamically:

In script.js, write a function to create a 16x16 grid of square <div> elements inside the container.
Use a for loop to create 16 * 16 (256) divs and append them to the container.
Add some default styles to the squares in your CSS (e.g., size, border).
Test Your Grid:

Open your project in the browser and ensure the grid displays correctly.
Debug any layout issues using browser developer tools.
Part 3: Hover Effect
Add Color Change on Hover:

Use JavaScript to add event listeners to each grid square for the mouseover event.
Change the background color of the square when the mouse hovers over it.
Start simple by using a single color for all hovers (e.g., black).
Test the Hover Effect:

Verify that the squares change color when you hover over them.
Part 4: User Input for Grid Size
Add a Button for Grid Size Input:

Add a <button> element in your HTML for resetting the grid.
Use prompt in JavaScript to ask the user for the new grid size.
Update the Grid Dynamically:

Clear the existing grid when the button is clicked.
Create a new grid based on the userâ€™s input.
Ensure the total container size stays fixed (e.g., 960px), and adjust the square sizes dynamically.
Part 5: Enhancements
Add Random Colors (Optional Extra Credit):

Modify the hover effect to change each square to a random color.
Darkening Effect (Optional Extra Credit):

Add a mechanism to darken each square progressively on multiple hovers.
Use the opacity property or an RGB value adjustment.
Part 6: Final Touches
Responsive Design:

Ensure the grid works well on different screen sizes (e.g., use percentages for container width).
Polish Your Code:

Clean up and organize your CSS and JavaScript.
Use comments to document your code.
